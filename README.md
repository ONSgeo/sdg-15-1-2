# **Goal 15**: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

## **Target 15.1**: By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements

### **Indicator 15.1.2**: Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type.

### Definition:
The indicator Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type shows temporal trends in the mean percentage of each important site for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity (i.e., those that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity) that is covered by designated protected areas and Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs).

### Concepts:

#### Protected Areas
Protected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN; Dudley 2008), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values.

The status **"designated"** is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. 

#### Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs)

KBAs or Important Sites for Terrestrial and Freshwater Biodiversity are sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity. KBAs are identified following global criteria set out in A Global Standard for the Identification of Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) (IUCN 2016) applied at national levels. KBAs encompass:

	Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs); BirdLife
	Important Plant Areas (IPAs); PlantLife
	Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZEs) sites. - None are located in UK
